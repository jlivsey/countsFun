#' This is a comparison of three methods.
#'
#'    1. Gaussian Liklihood as done in paper
#'    2. Gaussian likelihood done as 2-stage proceedure.
#'       First estimate $\lambda$ with $\bar{X}$ and then only use GL to estimate $\phi$
#'    3. Approximate GL as in Vladas note W-12-23-19-pseudo likelihood-2.pdf
