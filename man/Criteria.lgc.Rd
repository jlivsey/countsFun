\title{Compute AIC, BIC, and AICc for Model Evaluation}
\usage{
Criteria.lgc(loglik, mod)
}
\arguments{
\item{loglik}{Numeric. The log-likelihood value of the fitted model.}

\item{mod}{A list containing model-related metadata, typically created by
\code{\link{ModelScheme}}. It must include:
\itemize{
\item \code{nparms}: Number of estimated parameters.
\item \code{n}: Sample size.
\item \code{EstMethod}: Estimation method used ("GL" or "PFR").
}}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 3 containing the values:
\describe{
\item{\code{AIC}}{Akaike Information Criterion}
\item{\code{BIC}}{Bayesian Information Criterion}
\item{\code{AICc}}{Corrected Akaike Information Criterion}
}
}
\description{
Computes the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC),
and corrected AIC (AICc) for a fitted model, based on the log-likelihood, sample size,
and number of parameters. Adjustments are made depending on the estimation method.
}
\details{
For models estimated via Gaussian likelihood (\code{EstMethod = "GL"}), the log-likelihood
is adjusted by subtracting \code{n/2 * log(2Ï€)} to convert it to the classic likelihood form
used in AIC/BIC computation. For particle filter-based estimation methods (\code{"PFR"}),
no correction is applied.

This function is used to evaluate and compare model fits, especially when selecting among
candidate models of varying complexity.
