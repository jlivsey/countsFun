\title{Innovations Algorithm for Time Series Prediction}
\usage{
InnovAlg(Parms, gamma, mod)
}
\arguments{
\item{Parms}{A list containing the ARMA model parameters:
\itemize{
\item \code{AR}: Vector of autoregressive (AR) coefficients.
\item \code{MA}: Vector of moving average (MA) coefficients.
}}

\item{gamma}{Numeric vector. The autocovariance sequence of the observed time series.
Typically length \eqn{N}, where \eqn{N} is the time series length.}

\item{mod}{List. A list containing all model specifications, including:
\describe{
\item{DependentVar}{Numeric. The dependent time series variable to be modeled.}
\item{Task}{Character. The task requested by the user (e.g., Evaluation, Optimization, Synthesis, etc.).}
\item{ParticleNumber}{Integer. Number of particles to use.}
\item{Regressor}{Optional independent variable(s).}
\item{CountDist}{Character string. Specifies the count marginal distribution.}
}}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{n}}{Number of recursion steps performed.}
\item{\code{thetas}}{List of innovation coefficients (one per step). Each element is a vector of length \code{q}.}
\item{\code{v}}{Vector of innovation variances at each step (normalized by \code{v[1]}).}
}
}
\description{
Applies the Innovations Algorithm to compute the optimal one-step-ahead predictors
and associated prediction error variances based on the autocovariance sequence
of a stationary time series. The algorithm uses the ARMA parameters provided in
\code{Parms} and the autocovariance vector \code{gamma} to generate recursive
estimates of innovation coefficients and variances.
}
\details{
The recursion is terminated based on a fixed tolerance (\code{mod$maxdiff}) for variance convergence in MA models,
or after a fixed number of steps in AR-only models. The \code{kappa(i,j)} function computes the autocovariance
terms needed for recursion using model coefficients and the autocovariance vector \code{gamma}.
