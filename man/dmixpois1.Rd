\title{Mixture of Two Poisson Distributions (PMF)}
\usage{
dmixpois1(x, lam1, lam2, p, log = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Non-negative integer(s). Vector of quantiles.}

\item{lam1}{Mean of the first Poisson component (must be > 0).}

\item{lam2}{Mean of the second Poisson component (must be > 0).}

\item{p}{Mixing probability for the first component (0 <= p <= 1).}

\item{log}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, probabilities p are given as \code{log(p)}.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of mixture probabilities (or log-probabilities).
}
\description{
Computes the probability mass function of a two-component mixture of Poisson distributions.
}
\examples{
# Probability of observing exactly 3 under the mixture
dmixpois1(3, lam1 = 2, lam2 = 5, p = 0.4)

# Log-probability
dmixpois1(3, lam1 = 2, lam2 = 5, p = 0.4, log = TRUE)

# Vectorized input
dmixpois1(0:5, lam1 = 2, lam2 = 5, p = 0.4)
