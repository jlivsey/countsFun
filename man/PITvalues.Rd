\title{Compute Probability Integral Transform (PIT) Histogram Values}
\usage{
PITvalues(H, predDist)
}
\arguments{
\item{H}{Integer. Number of histogram bins to divide the [0,1] PIT range.}

\item{predDist}{A numeric matrix of dimension \code{2 x n}, typically returned by
\code{\link{PDvalues}}. Each column corresponds to a time point, with:
\itemize{
\item First row: lower tail probability of the observed count
\item Second row: cumulative probability including the observed count
}}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \code{H} representing the PIT histogram values (bin heights).
These can be plotted to assess calibration of predictive distributions.
}
\description{
Computes histogram values for the Probability Integral Transform (PIT) as described
in relations (39)â€“(40) of the JASA paper on latent Gaussian count time series modeling.
This function processes predictive distributions and outputs the PIT histogram bins
for calibration assessment.
}
\details{
The PIT is used to assess the \strong{calibration} of probabilistic forecasts. For discrete data,
the PIT is computed using randomized methods or as a piecewise function, as detailed in
the latent Gaussian count models literature.

This implementation applies the formulas:
\deqn{PIT(Y_t) \sim U(0,1)} if predictive distributions are correctly specified.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
predDist <- PDvalues(theta, mod)
hist(PITvalues(10, predDist), breaks = 10, main = "PIT Histogram")
}
