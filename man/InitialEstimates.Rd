\title{Compute Initial Parameter Estimates}
\usage{
InitialEstimates(mod)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{A list containing the full model specification, typically produced by
\code{\link{ModelScheme}}. It must include fields such as the count distribution
(\code{CountDist}), ARMA structure (\code{ARMAModel}), number of regressors,
and any relevant data needed to construct initial estimates.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of initial parameter estimates consistent with the model structure
described in \code{mod}. The vector includes:
\itemize{
\item Marginal distribution parameters
\item Regression coefficients (if any)
\item AR and MA coefficients
}
The names of the vector elements (if assigned) match those in \code{mod$parmnames}.
}
\description{
Generates initial parameter estimates based on the model specifications provided in \code{mod}.
These starting values are typically used as input to optimization routines or simulations in
count time series models with ARMA dependencies and various marginal count distributions.
}
\details{
The initial estimates are heuristically determined and may depend on the distribution
type, sample statistics (e.g., mean, variance), or defaults chosen for stability.
These estimates are used as starting points in numerical optimization procedures.

The function may include logic to handle different parameterization schemes
(e.g., for ZIP, Negative Binomial, or Generalized Poisson models) as well as
constraints on parameter domains.

mod <- ModelScheme(
  DependentVar = rpois(100, lambda = 3),
  CountDist = "Poisson",
  ARMAModel = c(1, 1),
  Intercept = TRUE

init <- InitialEstimates(mod)
print(init)
