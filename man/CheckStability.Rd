\title{Check Causality and Invertibility of ARMA Model}
\usage{
CheckStability(AR, MA)
}
\arguments{
\item{AR}{Numeric vector. Autoregressive (AR) coefficients of the model. Can be \code{NULL} if the model has no AR part.}

\item{MA}{Numeric vector. Moving average (MA) coefficients of the model. Can be \code{NULL} if the model has no MA part.}
}
\value{
Integer. Returns \code{1} if the model is \strong{not stable} (i.e., at least one root of the AR or MA polynomial lies inside the unit circle), and \code{0} if the model is stable.
}
\description{
Checks whether the specified ARMA model is stable â€” i.e., whether the AR polynomial
is causal and the MA polynomial is invertible. This is done by examining the
location of the roots of the characteristic polynomials.
}
\details{
The function uses \code{\link[base]{polyroot}} to compute the roots of the AR and MA characteristic polynomials:
\itemize{
\item The AR polynomial is defined as \eqn{1 - AR_1 z - AR_2 z^2 - \dots}.
\item The MA polynomial is defined similarly.
}
If any root lies \strong{within} the unit circle (i.e., has modulus < 1), the model is considered unstable.
}
\examples{
# Stable ARMA(1,1)
CheckStability(AR = 0.5, MA = 0.3)  # returns 0

# Unstable ARMA(1,1)
CheckStability(AR = 1.2, MA = 0.3)  # returns 1

# AR-only model
CheckStability(AR = c(0.9), MA = NULL)

# MA-only model
CheckStability(AR = NULL, MA = c(1.5))
